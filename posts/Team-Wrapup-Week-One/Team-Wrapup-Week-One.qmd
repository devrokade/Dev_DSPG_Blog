## DSPG Questions

Treat this section as a place to put all of the different questions that team members have about the work they've been completing so far. This can be things like;

-   How to best create a certain plot.
-   What package/module might be the best fit for the task.
-   An idea that can be discussed with the larger group for additional thoughts.
