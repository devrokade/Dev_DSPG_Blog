# Week One Highlights

In week one, I first made sure all my github and datacamp accounts were in order. However, due to some issues with datacamp, did not get a head start on training.

Day 1: Did k-means clustering and statistical analysis on the flight data of scheduled flights and actual flights in 90-minute data science exercise. Presented findings to the whole DSPG team.
