However, due to some issues with datacamp, did not get a head start on training.\nDay 1: Did k-means clustering and statistical analysis on the flight data of scheduled flights and actual flights in 90-minute data science exercise. Presented findings to the whole DSPG team.\n\n\n\n\nDay 2: Went through past DSPG projects.\nDay 3: Met with Courtney Long to discuss project expectations, fixed DataCamp access issues by meeting Rakesh and Chris"
